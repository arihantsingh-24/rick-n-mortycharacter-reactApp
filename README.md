Features of the project
1. Search bar
We will be building this cool search bar so that we can search for our favourite characters.
2.Pagination
In total there are 800+ characters. In order to display and manage all of these characters, we will be implementing a pagination system where each page will display 20 characters.
3.Filters
There are lots of labels present in the API. Using them, we can filter our data and search for exactly what we need.
4.Routing
We will implement this component to change our pages and create a navbar. We will use the library called react-router-dom to do this.
5.Dynamic Routing
Using react-router-dom, we will also add dynamic routing so that we can learn more about a character when we click on it.
